 It is an online and simple application where you can follow your employees step by step and see which notes they get.  The employer opens an account for his employees. Employees with this account can log in and use the system.  Every job has certain stages. The employer determines the stages and situations. Sorts the stages according to the workflow. Employees can add grades to their work by choosing a stage and status.  Employers and employees register customers. There is no one working with that customer in the first registration. Employees from the 'Select Customer' section start working with that customer.  A customer can run a healthy workflow with only one employee. For this reason, only one employee can select a customer and add notes. The customer can be transferred to a different employee in case of any dispute during the work flow process, and if the employee requests it.  It is a simple and useful project for the employees to not be able to interfere with each other's work and for the employees and employers to follow the jobs properly.
